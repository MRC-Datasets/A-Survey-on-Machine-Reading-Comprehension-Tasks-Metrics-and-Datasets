# A-Survey-on-Machine-Reading-Comprehension-Tasks-Metrics-and-Datasets

Abstract: Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is a challenging NLP research field with wide real world applications. The great progress of this field in recent years is mainly due to the 2
emergence of large-scale datasets and deep learning. At present, a lot of MRC models have already surpassed the human performance on many datasets despite the obvious giant gap between 4
existing MRC models and genuine human-level reading comprehension. This shows the need of improving existing datasets, evaluation metrics and models to move the MRC models toward ’real’ 6
understanding. To address this lack of comprehensive survey of existing MRC tasks, evaluation metrics and datasets, herein, (1) we analyzed 57 MRC tasks and datasets; proposed a more precise 8
classification method of MRC tasks with 4 different attributes (2) we summarized 9 evaluation metrics of MRC tasks and (3) 7 attributes and 10 characteristics of MRC datasets; (4) We also discussed 10
some open issues in MRC research and highlight some future research directions. In addition, to help the community, we have collected, organized, and published our data on a companion 12
website(https://mrc-datasets.github.io/) where MRC researchers could directly access each MRC dataset, papers, baseline projects and browse the leaderboard.
